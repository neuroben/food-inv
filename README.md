## Project Update: Transitioning to React

I've decided to discontinue the food-inv project and am now shifting my focus to mastering React fundamentals. Exploring the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for element manipulation has been a valuable learning experience. While utilizing Strapi for content management, I encountered some issues and had to roll back to an older version. Excited for the new challenges and opportunities ahead with React!
